        <h1> BITCOIN (BTC) </h1>
        <p> Bitcoin as of now is one of the more valuable cryptocurrencies, from my knowledge is comes at around 1 bitcoing
            equalling to around 10,000 usd, which is quite and is why large sums of bitcoin are veryu expensive and bitcoin was
        worth nothing before around 2019 to what i know, and to add to that bitcoin worth a lot today. </p>

        <h1> Ethereum (ETH) </h1>
        <p> Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain system that introduced a revolutionary feature: smart 
            contracts. While Bitcoin pioneered digital currency, Ethereum expanded blockchain's potential by becoming a 
            global, programmable settlement layer.
Its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used to power the network. Users pay fees in ETH to execute smart contracts and 
transactions. These smart contracts 
are self-executing agreements with terms directly written into code, enabling the creation of decentralized applications 
(dApps) without intermediaries. </p>

        <h1> Tether (USDT) </h1>
        <p> Tether's primary purpose is to combine the benefits of a 
            cryptocurrency—fast, global transactions—with the stable value of a 
            traditional currency. Most commonly, Tether tokens are pegged 1:1 to 
            the US Dollar, meaning one USDT is intended to always
             be worth one US dollar.
To maintain this peg, Tether Limited, the company behind USDT, states that each 
token is fully backed by a reserve of assets. These reserves are meant to include 
cash, cash equivalents, and other assets like commercial paper, which can be 
liquidated to honor redemptions. </p>

        <h1> XRP (XRP) </h1>
        <p> XRP is the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), an open-source, public blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin, which was created as decentralized money, or Ethereum, as a programmable platform, XRP was designed with a very specific primary purpose: facilitating fast, low-cost, cross-border payments and currency exchanges.

It was created by the company Ripple Labs, which builds enterprise solutions for financial institutions, often using XRP as a "bridge currency" to solve liquidity problems in international transactions. </p>
